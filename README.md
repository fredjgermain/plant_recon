# plant_recon
This is a demo project that uses deep learning to perform visual recognition of images of fruits; apple, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. 

It is based on a Udemy tutorial from the course "Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp" by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke. The initial tutorial was aimed at visual recognition of dogs breeds, but I changed it to the recognition of fruits. The data (images) is mostly stock photos I took from google image search, but also some are fruits from my own garden. I also refactored the code for my personal style and for ease of reading. 

The training set is limited (3000 photos), but the project is functional and serves it's purpose as a simple demo project. The model was trained to recognize a limited number of fruits, but the model perform well in its limited domain of application. 

You may take a look at the following notebook which display the code used and some of the testing.
